A PhonePe Dashboard that visualizes transaction data from 2018 to 2022 across India! ðŸ“Š

Using the PhonePe Pulse Dataset from Kaggle, Iâ€™ve created an interactive dashboard that breaks down transaction amounts, counts, and trends by state, region, and year. Hereâ€™s a quick snapshot of what the dashboard covers:

Total Transaction Amount: â‚¹121.41T
Average Transaction Value: â‚¹1.69K
Total Transaction Count: 72bn
Top Transaction Type: Financial Services
The dashboard also highlights transaction trends in key states like Telangana, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, which have shown significant growth in transaction volumes over the years. ðŸ“ˆ

Key Insights: -Regional Breakdown: Southern and Western regions lead in transaction volumes, with the Southern region contributing 39.69% of total transactions. -Yearly Growth: Transaction amounts have consistently grown from 2018 to 2022, reflecting the increasing adoption of digital payments in India.

This project was a great opportunity to dive deep into data visualization and explore the growing digital payment landscape in India. ðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ
